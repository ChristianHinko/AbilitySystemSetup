This is our minimal and non-intruding setup for the Gameplay Ability System. Provides several base classes with helpful tools. And contains the UAbilitySystemSetupComponent and IAbilitySystemSetupInterface for a modular setup for Pawns and Characters that are Avatar Actors of the ASC from the Player State.

This also currently contains several extra helpful classes such as Attribute Sets, Ability Tasks, Target Actors, Target Data Filters, and Blueprint Async Actions. We plan on separating these into an "Extras" plugin but haven't done so yet.
