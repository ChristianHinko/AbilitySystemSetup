This is our minimal and non-intruding setup for the Gameplay Ability System. Provides several base classes with helpful tools. And contains the UAbilitySystemSetupComponent and IAbilitySystemSetupInterface for a modular setup for Pawns and Characters that are Avatar Actors of the ASC from the Player State.
